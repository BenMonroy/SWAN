Procedures for proposing, evaluating, and justifying relevant changes to system/component provenance for their impact on components, processes, systems, missions, and exposure to supply chain risks; 2. Procedures for allocating responsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance are documented; 3. Methods for tracking relevant purchasing, shipping, receiving, or transfer activities, including records of reviewer signatures for comparison; 4. Processes for transferring provenance responsibility for systems or components between organizations across physical and logical boundaries including any approvals required; 5. Procedures for tracking and documenting chain of custody of the system or component (Labeling (using serial numbers) and tagging (using radio-frequency identification [RFID] tags); and 6. Security reviews for evaluating and vetting key personnel employed by acquirers or suppliers in any capacity (full-time employee, part-time employee, consultant, contractor, subcontractor, vendor, agent, etc) DoD has determined the elements, processes, and actors are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
