Conduct a criticality analysis to identify mission critical functions and critical components and reduce the vulnerability of such functions and components through secure system design; 2. Request threat analysis of suppliers of critical components from the TSN focal point and manage access to and control of threat analysis products containing U.S. person information; 3.
